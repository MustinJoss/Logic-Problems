        <h4>Squirrels and Cigars</h4>
        <p>When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars.
           A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between
           40 and 60, inclusive - unless it is the weekend, in which case there
           is no upper bound on the number of cigars.</p>
        <p>What day is the party? (Choose from the list)</p>
        <form>
            <select id="daySelect">
                <option value = "sunday">Sunday</option>
                <option value = "monday">Monday</option>
                <option value = "tuesday">Tuesday</option>
